# Assignment 1: Neural Word Embeddings and Language Models

This assignment has three parts:

- [**Part 0: Fun with TensorFlow**](part0/part0_fun_with_tensorflow.ipynb) (warm-up - 7 points)
- [**Part 1: GloVe Embeddings**](part1/part1-glove.ipynb) (25 points)
- [**Part 2: RNN Language Model**](part2/part2-rnnlm.ipynb) (45 points)

### Collaboration policy

The work you submit must be your own. You are permitted to discuss the 
assignment at a high level with other students, but you should not share code, 
implementation details, or specific solutions.

More specifically:
- You may collaborate verbally with other students, but you should not look at 
  or help debug each other's code.
- You can get help on general programming issues, but only in a very general 
  capacity that does not relate to a specific part of the assignment. (example: 
  "Oh, I had issues with that function crashing, but updating TensorFlow to 0.10 
  fixed it for me.") If in doubt, ask in a *private* question on Piazza.
- You should not search for or use solutions to the assignment problems that you 
  find on the web. If you inadvertently come across such a solution, you 
  **must** cite it appropriately in your answer. (Bad search: "how to implement 
  GloVe in TensorFlow". Good search: "how to use `tf.variable_scope`" or "how to 
  concatenate matricies")
- You should not use external libraries to shortcut parts of the assignment. The 
  libraries imported in the starter code should be more than sufficient, 
  although you're welcome to use standard Python libraries like `pdb` or 
  `itertools` if you desire.

### Due date and submissions

Please do your work in a `git` repository; you can simply clone the course repo 
to get started. If there are any updates or fixes to the assignment, we'll 
update the master repo and you can patch your client with `git pull`.

Be sure to **`git commit`** often to save your work!

All parts of this assignment are due on **November 13, 2016**.
Submissions will be done via GitHub; we'll release a submit script closer to the due date. 
If you haven't already, be sure to [enter your GitHub username and Berkeley ID here](https://goo.gl/forms/wiyDmlozh5yLh1hr1) 
so that the course staff can properly receive your submission.
